      "description": "An attacker could have exploited a vulnerability known as CVE-2020-0601 by using a spoofed code-signing certificate to sign a malicious executable, making it appear the file was from a trusted, legitimate source. The user would have no way of knowing the file was malicious, because the digital signature would appear to be from a trusted provider. A successful exploit could have allowed the attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks and decrypt confidential information on user connections to the affected software.",
